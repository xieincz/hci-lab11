## Feedbacks
### Criticism
- User Interface Design
  - Issue 1:
    - Non-intuitive navigation (Moderate severity)- Evaluation: User flow analysis indicates that non-intuitive navigation increases user steps and confusion, leading to a decrease in overall satisfaction.
    - Improvement Measures: We will conduct usability testing to identify the most intuitive navigation structure and implement these improvements in the design.

  - Issue 2:
    - Unfriendly color scheme for color-blind users (High severity)- Evaluation: Color accessibility is a crucial aspect of design, and our product should be inclusive for all users.
    - Improvement Measures: We will follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines, choosing a color scheme with strong contrast and friendliness for color-blind users.

- Feature Implementation
  - Issue 3:
    - Slow search function (High severity)- Evaluation: Speed is a key aspect of user experience, and poor search performance directly impacts the user's impression of the product.
    - Improvement Measures: We plan to optimize indices, implement code-level optimizations, and evaluate new database options to enhance query performance.

  - Issue 4:
    - Inadequate mobile adaptation (Moderate severity)- Evaluation: With the increasing mobile traffic, mobile adaptability becomes crucial.
    - Improvement Measures: We will adhere to responsive design principles and make layout adjustments with a mobile-first approach.

- Response to each issue:

  - Issue 1 is from user A's feedback. We plan to simplify the navigation bar, add icons, and tooltips to enhance intuitiveness.
  - Issue 2 is from user B's feedback. We will adjust the color scheme, using high-contrast colors friendly to color-blind users.
  - Issue 3 was identified in user test C. We will optimize backend query logic and may introduce a faster database solution.
  - Issue 4 was raised by user D. We will redesign the mobile interface to ensure all features work well on small screens.

Improvements: After addressing the above issues, we anticipate a significant enhancement in user experience, especially for users with visual impairments. Additionally, improving feature performance will increase user satisfaction and the overall responsiveness of the system.
